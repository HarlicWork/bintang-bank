## Start the app

This Nx React Native template project is here to jumpstart enterprise mobile app development project.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks in this project with Nx, use the following syntax:

### Run in iOS simulator

```
yarn ios:mobile
```

### Run in Android emulator

```
yarn android:mobile
```

Note: Check the `project.json` in mobile-app folder, watchman clear, ensure-symlink, sync-deps already automated when call above command using `dependOn` option.

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Ready to deploy?

For Android, just run `yarn build-android` to build the application. The build artifacts or .apk will be stored in the `{projectRoot}/android/app/build/outputs/apk` directory, ready to be install in Android devices.

For iOS, you need to open the `{projectRoot}/ios/mobile-app.xcworkspace` in XCode and build the application from there.
