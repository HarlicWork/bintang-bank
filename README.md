## Architecture

This project is using [Feature-Sliced Design Architecture](https://feature-sliced.design/) to structure the codebase. The project is divided into several layers, each layer is a self-contained module that can be developed and tested independently.

Application reside in apps folder, while each FSD (assets, widgets, entities, pages, features, shared) layer reside in libs folder. Each feature is a self-contained module that can be developed and tested independently (run `nx test {layers_name}`).

See below graph on how that architecture linked together:

Note: You can also use [Nx Graph](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nx/documents/dep-graph#graph) to visualize the dependency graph of this projects. Run `nx graph`.
You might need to install Nx globally first using `yarn global add nx@latest` or `npm install --global nx@latest` if you haven't done so.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks in this project with Nx, use the following syntax:

### Run in iOS simulator

```
yarn ios:mobile
```

### Run in Android emulator

```
yarn android:mobile
```

Note: Check the `project.json` in mobile-app folder, watchman clear, ensure-symlink, sync-deps (pod-install for ios!) already automated when call above command using `dependOn` option, along with metro resetCache.

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Ready to deploy?

For Android, just run `yarn build-android` to build the application. The build artifacts or .apk will be stored in the `{projectRoot}/android/app/build/outputs/apk` directory, ready to be install in Android devices.

For iOS, you need to open the `{projectRoot}/ios/mobile-app.xcworkspace` in XCode and build the application from there.
